Status: _not functional (planning)_

A javascript library to use intermodal route planning advice in the browser or in your nodejs applications.

## Install and use it

Install it:
```bash
npm install lc-client
```

For use on the command line:
```bash
# uses by default the config-example.json which comes with this repo
lcc -c config.json '{}'
```

Use it as a library:
```bash
var Client = require('lc-client');
var planner = new Client({"config":"object"});
var resultStream = planner.query({"query":"object"});
resultStream.on('data', function (path) {
    console.log(path);
});
```

Using it in the browser works in a similar way, by e.g., using browserify to generate a build file that can be used in the browser
```bash
browserify ...
```
